### **Features to achieve the goals:**

### **Wireframes**
I created wireframes to visualize my ideas using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/). As I want to stick to the mobile first approach I created wireframes for mobile, tablet and desktop screen sizes.

### **Color Scheme**
To create the color scheme I looked at various pictures of dogs I might use as hero images. I quickly decided to go for green as my main color and picked `#83A603` to be one of my main colors. Then I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/) to find matching colors for my scheme. After picking out my five main colors I used [contrast-grid.eightshapes.com](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/?version=1.1.0&background-colors=&foreground-colors=%2383a603%0D%0A%231b4001%0D%0A%23f0deb4%0D%0A%23f6f7eb%0D%0A%23001e1d&es-color-form__tile-size=regular&es-color-form__show-contrast=aaa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa18&es-color-form__show-contrast=dnp) to check the contrast and possible color combinations.

### **Fonts**
I used [fontpair.co](https://www.fontpair.co/) to get some inspiration for possible Font Pairings. I wanted to use [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and decided to use **Nunito** for my headings and **PT Sans** for my text. These two fonts seem to pair nicely and I like the rounded, playful shape of Nunito for the topic of this website.

### **Logo**
After choosing my colors and fonts I wanted to make a simple Logo for my website, as the *Furry Friends Shelter* does not exist in the real world. I used my colors and fonts for the creation of the Logo. The paw prints I used are my own dogs paws.
