            <h2>Find your new best friend here</h2>
            <p>We receive many dogs looking for a new home. We make sure to give them enough time to arrive in our
                shelter before putting them up for adoption.<br>
                All dogs are spayed/neutered, have a microchip and have all required vaccines. If they have any health
                problems we will make sure the new owner knows about them and can handle the dog correctly.</p>
            <p>If you are interested in one of the dogs <a href="contact.html" aria-label="link to Contact page">contact
                    us</a> or visit us during our opening hours.</p>
