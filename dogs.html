            <p>We recieve many dogs looking for a new home. We make sure to give them enough time to arrive in our shelter before putting them up for adoption.<br>
            All dogs are spayed/neutered, have a microchip and all required vaccines. If they have any health problems we will make sure the new owner knows about them and is able to handle the dog correctly.</p>
            <p>If you are interested in one of the dogs <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> or visit us during our opening hours.</p>
